            Go is a procedural programming language. It was developed in 2007 by
            Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google but launched
            in 2009 as an open-source programming language. Programs are
            assembled by using packages, for efficient management of
            dependencies. This language also supports environment adopting
            patterns alike to dynamic languages. For eg., type inference (y := 0
            is a valid declaration of a variable y of type float).
          </p>
          <p>
            Go is a statically typed, concurrent, and garbage-collected
            programming language created at Google in 2009. It is designed to be
            simple, efficient, and easy to learn, making it a popular choice for
            building scalable network services, web applications, and
            command-line tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Go is known for its support for concurrency, which is the ability to
            run multiple tasks simultaneously. Concurrency is achieved in Go
            through the use of Goroutines and Channels, which allow you to write
            code that can run multiple operations at the same time. This makes
            Go an ideal choice for building high-performance and scalable
            network services, as well as for solving complex computational
            problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another important feature of Go is its garbage collection, which
            automatically manages memory for you. This eliminates the need for
            manual memory management, reducing the likelihood of memory leaks
            and other bugs that can arise from manual memory management.
          </p>
          <p>
            Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source programming language
            created by Google in 2007. It was designed to be efficient, easy to
            learn, and to provide support for modern hardware architectures. Go
            is often used for building large-scale distributed systems and
            high-performance applications.
          </p>
          <p>Here are some key features of Go:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Statically typed</li>
            <li>Concurrent</li>
            <li>Garbage-collected</li>
            <li>Simple and efficient</li>
            <li>Support for modern hardware architectures</li>
            <li>Support for networked and multicore computing</li>

        <article>
          <p>
            In programming languages, identifiers are used for identification
            purposes. In other words, identifiers are the user-defined names of
            the program components. In the Go language, an identifier can be a
            variable name, function name, constant, statement label, package
            name, or type.
          </p>
          <p>Example:</p>
          <code
            >package main import "fmt" func main() { var name = "GeeksforGeeks"
            }
          </code>
          <p>
            There is a total of three identifiers available in the above
            example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>main: </strong>Name of the package</li>
            <li><strong>main: </strong>Name of the function</li>
            <li><strong>name: </strong>Name of the variable</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Rules for Defining Identifiers:</strong> There are certain
            valid rules for defining a valid Go identifier. These rules should
            be followed, otherwise, we will get a compile-time error.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The name of the identifier must begin with a letter or an
              underscore(_). And the names may contain the letters ‘a-z’ or
              ’A-Z’ or digits 0-9 as well as the character ‘_’.
            </li>
            <li>The name of the identifier should not start with a digit.</li>
            <li>The name of the identifier is case-sensitive.</li>
            <li>Keywords are not allowed to be used as an identifier name.</li>
            <li>
              There is no limit on the length of the name of the identifier, but
              it is advisable to use an optimum length of 4 – 15 letters only.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section id="Go_Keywords" class="main-section">
        <header>Go Keywords</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Keywords or Reserved words are the words in a language that are used
            for some internal process or represent some predefined actions.
            These words are therefore not allowed to use as an identifier. Doing
            this will result in a compile-time error.
          </p>
          <p>Example:</p>
          <code>
            // Go program to illustrate the // use of keywords package main
            import "fmt" // Here, package, import, func, // var are keywords
            func main() { // Here, a is a valid identifier var a =
            "GeeksforGeeks" fmt.Println(a) // Here, the default is an // illegal
            identifier and // compiler will throw an error // var default =
            "GFG" }
          </code>
          <p>Output:</p>
          <code>GeeksforGeeks</code>
          <p>
            There are total 25 keywords present in the Go language as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>break</li>
            <li>default</li>

        <article>
          <p>
            Data types specify the type of data that a valid Go variable can
            hold. In Go language, the type is divided into four categories which
            are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Basic type: Numbers, strings, and booleans come under this
              category.
            </li>
            <li>Aggregate type: Array and structs come under this category.</li>
            <li>
              Reference type: Pointers, slices, maps, functions, and channels
              come under this category.
            </li>
            <li>Interface type</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Here, we will discuss Basic Data Types in the Go language. The Basic
            Data Types are further categorized into three subcategories which
            are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Numbers</li>

            A typical program uses various values that may change during its
            execution. For Example, a program that performs some operations on
            the values entered by the user. The values entered by one user may
            differ from those entered by another user. Hence this makes it
            necessary to use variables as another user may not use the same
            values. When a user enters a new value that will be used in the
            process of operation, can store temporarily in the Random Access
            Memory of the computer and these values in this part of memory vary
            throughout the execution and hence another term for this came which
            is known as Variables. So basically, a Variable is a placeholder of
            the information which can be changed at runtime. And variables allow
            to Retrieve and Manipulate the stored information.
          </p>
          <p>Rules for Naming Variables:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Variable names must begin with a letter or an underscore(_). And
              the names may contain the letters ‘a-z’ or ’A-Z’ or digits 0-9 as
              well as the character ‘_’.
              <code
                >Geeks, geeks, _geeks23 // valid variable 123Geeks, 23geeks //
                invalid variable</code
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              A variable name should not start with a digit.
              <code>234geeks // illegal variable</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              The name of the variable is case sensitive.
              <code>geeks and Geeks are two different variables</code>
            </li>
            <li>Keywords is not allowed to use as a variable name.</li>
            <li>
              There is no limit on the length of the name of the variable, but
              it is advisable to use an optimum length of 4 – 15 letters only.
            </li>
          </ul>

      <section id="Constants" class="main-section">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            As the name CONSTANTS suggests, it means fixed. In programming
            languages also it is same i.e., once the value of constant is
            defined, it cannot be modified further. There can be any basic data
            type of constants like an integer constant, a floating constant, a
            character constant, or a string literal.
          </p>
          <p>Example:</p>
          <code
            >package main import "fmt" const PI = 3.14 func main() { const GFG =
            "GeeksforGeeks" fmt.Println("Hello", GFG) fmt.Println("Happy", PI,
            "Day") const Correct= true fmt.Println("Go rules?", Correct) }

            Operators are the foundation of any programming language. Thus the
            functionality of the Go language is incomplete without the use of
            operators. Operators allow us to perform different kinds of
            operations on operands. In the Go language, operators Can be
            categorized based on their different functionality:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
